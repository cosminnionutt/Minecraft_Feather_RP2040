# Server Plugins Setup

### World Edit

To paste the Feather from the schematic file you need the [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) plugin.

Download the the latest version and place the .jar file inside the `plugins` directory in your server directory.

Copy the [Pink Feather Schematic](schematics/pink_feather.schematic) and paste it into the `plugins/WorldEdit/schematics/` directory.


### Feather Plugin

The Feather uses a custom plugin in order to sync the state between the virtual Feather in Minecraft and the real one plugged in via USB.

Install the [Feather Interface Plugin](minecraft_feather_plugin/CircuitPython_Feather_Interface-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) by pasting a copy of it into your `plugins` folder.
