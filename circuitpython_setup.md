# CircuitPython Device Setup

- Copy [code.py](circuitpython_code/code.py) and paste it on your CIRCUITPY drive. 

- Find and note the serial port your device is connected under. For me this is typically `/dev/ttyACM0` for the first circuitpython device plugged in to my computer. You'll need to know the port in order to initialize the feather syncing.
